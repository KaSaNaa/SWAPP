# SWAPP - Space Weather App

Welcome to SWAPP, your go-to app for monitoring space weather conditions! SWAPP is an android mobile application designed to provide users with up-to-date information on various space weather phenomena, including solar flares, geomagnetic storms, and more.

## Goals

The primary goal of SWAPP is to develop a user-friendly and informative app that allows users to stay informed about space weather events. Our main objectives include:

- Providing real-time updates on space weather conditions sourced from reliable data sources, such as NASA's DONKI API.
- Displaying space weather data in a clear and intuitive manner, ensuring ease of understanding for users.
- Implementing basic functionalities to fetch and display space weather data, with the potential for future enhancements and features.
- Creating a simple yet visually appealing user interface that enhances the user experience.
- Building a scalable and maintainable codebase that allows for easy expansion and updates.

## Current Ideas

While we are in the initial stages of development, here are some ideas we're considering for SWAPP:

- Implementing features to display solar flare events, geomagnetic storms, and other space weather phenomena.
- Providing notifications to users for significant space weather events based on their preferences.
- Integrating caching mechanisms to improve app performance and offline access to data.
- Designing a user interface that prioritizes readability and usability, with the potential for customization options in future versions.

## Getting Started

As development progresses, we'll update this section with instructions on how to install and run SWAPP on your mobile device or emulator. Stay tuned for further updates!
